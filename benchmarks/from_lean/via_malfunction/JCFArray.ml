(* Persistent arrays implemented using Baker's trick.

   A persistent array is a usual array (node Array) or a change into
   another persistent array (node Diff). Invariant: any persistent array is a
   (possibly empty) linked list of Diff nodes ending on an Array node.

   As soon as we try to access a Diff, we reverse the linked list to move
   the Array node to the position we are accessing; this is achieved with
   the reroot function.
